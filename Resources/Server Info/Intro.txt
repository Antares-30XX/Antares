Welcome to Antares 30XX! You have just started your shift aboard an Antares spaceship and along with your crewmates should cooperate, perform your job role to the best of your ability and have fun (not at the expense of others hopefully).

Please make sure you understand the server rules (F1) and if you have any questions, consult this guide, your colleagues on shift in person or over radio or via discord. You can also ask admins for help (ahelp) by hitting the escape key > admin help and typing a message to any online admins. Especially do this if you witness someone breaking rules.
